Once you have a not so nice rev shell you can upgrade it to have tab complete etc if there is python installed on the machine using the following:


python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Ctrl+z to background process

echo $TERM   (usually xterm-256color)
stty -a  (remember the rows and columns, don't adjust the console after entering these #'s)

stty raw -echo

fg (press enter you won't see the fg in the terminal)

reset

export SHELL=bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
stty rows <ur rows here> columns <ur columns here>
